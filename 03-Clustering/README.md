# Clustering Algorithms

In real world, data does not always come with labels and in such cases, we need to create our own clusters/labels in order to make some groupings in the data. This is called unsupervised learning. The following algorithms are used to do this:

1. [K-Means Clustering](./01-K-meansClustering.md)
2. [Hierarchical Clustering](./02-HierarchicalClustering.md)
3. [Gaussian Mixture Models](./03-GaussianMixtureModels.md)

There are a few other terms that are commonly associated with unsupervised learning as application areas. 
### Density Estimation
The process of taking a sample of data and estimating the probability density function of a random variable is called density estimation. Once the distribution is learnt, one can generate samples that look like they are coming from the same distribution.

### Latent Variables
Underlying cause in the form of latent or missing variables can be figured out using the unsupervised learning techniques. 

### Dimensionality Reduction
This topic is covered in depth, in a separate section of the book. Please refer to the index page for more details regarding the same.
