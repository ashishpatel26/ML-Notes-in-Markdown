## Types of Time Series

### Cross-Sectional Data
It consists of variables, that are either quantitative or qualitative for a lot of different observations 
(usually called 'cases') and are taken from some defined population. All the cases are registered at a single
point in time, or a reasonably short period of time. The techniques commonly used for this kind of data are 't-tests' analysis of variance or regression depending on the kind and number of variables that are there in the data. It is noteworthy that **each observation of a given variable or each set of variables are independent of every other observation in the dataset**. The independence of the variables is a critical assumption when modelling cross-sectional data. 

> It is called cross-sectional data because we are measuring a cross-section of a defined population at a particular point in time or a very short period in time.
